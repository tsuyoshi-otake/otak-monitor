  - Regular updates

- **Disk Usage Monitoring**:
  - Cross-platform disk space monitoring
    - Windows: C: drive (home directory in Codespaces)
    - macOS: Root volume (/)
    - Linux: Root filesystem (workspace root in Codespaces)
  - Shows used and total space in GB
  - Disk usage percentage
  - 1-minute moving average

- **Visual Integration**:
  - Clean status bar integration
  - Right-aligned placement
  - Non-intrusive display
  - Interactive status bar item:
    - Current CPU, memory, and disk metrics
    - 1-minute average values

    - Click to copy metrics in Markdown format

- **Clipboard Integration**:
  - Copy system metrics with a single click
  - Well-formatted Markdown output
  - Includes timestamps for reference
  - Temporary notification with auto-dismiss

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code ^1.90.0
- Supported environments:
  - Local: Windows, macOS, Linux
  - Remote: GitHub Codespaces

## Installation

1. Install the extension from VS Code Marketplace
2. Look for the CPU usage display in your status bar
3. Hover over it to see detailed system information
4. Click to copy current metrics in Markdown format

## Status Bar Display

The extension shows the following information in your status bar:

```
CPU: 45.3%  // CPU usage
```

Hover over the status bar to see detailed information:
```
Current:

---

CPU Usage: 45.3% (2400 MHz)
Memory Usage: 1024 MB / 2048 MB (50.0%)
Disk Usage: 150 GB / 500 GB (30.0%)
```

Click the status bar item to copy metrics in Markdown format:

# System Metrics (2024-02-24 14:00:00)

## Current Status
- **CPU Usage:** 45.3% @ 2400 MHz
- **Memory Usage:** 1024 MB / 2048 MB (50.0%)
- **Disk Usage (C:):** 150 GB / 500 GB (30.0%)

## 1-Minute Average
- **CPU:** 44.8%
- **Memory:** 49.5%
- **Disk:** 30.0%
```

Note: For disk usage, the monitored path varies by environment:
- Windows:
  - Local: C: drive
  - Codespaces: Home directory
- macOS: Root volume (/)
- Linux:
  - Local: Root filesystem (/)
  - Codespaces: Workspace root

## Implementation Details

- CPU usage is calculated by comparing idle and total CPU time differences
- Memory values are shown in MB and percentage
- Disk usage monitoring adapts to the environment:
  - Local machines: Monitors system root or C: drive
  - Codespaces: Monitors relevant workspace paths
- Moving averages are calculated using 24 data points (2.5-second intervals over 1 minute)
- Updates occur every 2.5 seconds (5 seconds when window is not focused) for efficient monitoring
- Minimal performance impact on the system

## GitHub Codespaces Support

The extension automatically detects when running in GitHub Codespaces and adjusts its behavior:
- Monitors the workspace root directory in Linux environments
- Uses home directory for Windows-based Codespaces
- Maintains consistent monitoring experience across all environments
- Provides accurate disk usage information for containerized development
